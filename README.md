# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This simple console-based game allows you to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer.

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to make your moves.
3. The game board is displayed after each move.
4. The game ends when a player wins, loses, or the board is full (tie).
5. You can choose to restart the game or exit after each round.

## Game Logic
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- The user plays as "X," and the computer plays as "O."
- The game checks for win conditions after each move.
- If the board is full and no one has won, the game ends in a tie.

## How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your system, and then run the script:

python tic_tac_toe.py
